A real-world **Sales Analytics** pipeline built using `dbt` + BigQuery.

This project cleans and transforms raw sales data into **trusted business insights**, while also serving as a learning environment to practice dbt:

✅ Staging models  
✅ Final analytics models  
✅ Sources + Schema tests  
✅ Documentation + GitHub Pages hosting  
✅ CI-ready project structure

## ❌ My Mistakes & ✅ How I Fixed Them

| Issue                                    | What Happened                                     | Solution                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ 1. Virtual env not activated           | `dbt not recognized` error                        | Use: `dbt-env\Scripts\activate` BEFORE running dbt                     |
| ✅ 2. Wrong dbt path quoting              | Used `'project.dataset.table'` → SQL syntax error | Must use **backticks** in BigQuery: <br> `` `project.dataset.table` `` |
| ✅ 3. Macro missing                       | `dynamic_partition` undefined                     | Removed unused macro / ensured correct syntax                          |
| ✅ 4. Wrong reference to raw table        | Missing `source()`                                | Used: `from {{ source('sales_database', 'raw_sales') }}`               |
| ✅ 5. Stale target folder caused failures | BigQuery still saw failed view                    | Fix: `dbt clean && dbt run`                                            |

✅ All fixed successfully ✔

And publish the `target/` docs output there.

📌 Before I send commands — I need ONE more detail:

Where is your Git repo?

Choose one:

A️⃣ Repo already exists on GitHub  
✅ You already pushed the project (tell me repo name like: `Sales_Analytics`)

B️⃣ Repo not created yet  
✅ I will give you commands to create + push + deploy docs
